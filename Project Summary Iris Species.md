## 📌 Project Summary: Iris Species Classification 🌸
This project uses the Iris flower dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts the species of an iris flower based on four features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

### ✅ Steps Followed:
- Imported the dataset using scikit-learn

- Explored the data using Pandas and Seaborn (EDA)

- Visualized patterns using pairplots and heatmaps

- Preprocessed the dataset (split & scaled)

- Trained and tested three ML models:

    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

    - Decision Tree Classifier

- Evaluated models using accuracy and classification report

### 📊 Model Performance:
SVM and KNN typically perform the best on this dataset.

Accuracy often ranges from 95% to 100%.

### 📁 Tools Used:
- Python, Jupyter Notebook

- Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

- Scikit-learn (sklearn)
