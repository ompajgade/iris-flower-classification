# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project applies machine learning techniques to classify iris flowers into three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** using the popular Iris dataset. The goal is to build predictive models and compare their performance.

## 📌 Project Overview

- 📂 Dataset: Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`
- 🧪 Goal: Classify iris species based on petal and sepal dimensions
- 🔍 Techniques: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature scaling, model training, and evaluation
- 🤖 Models used: Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree Classifier

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Libraries:**
  - Pandas, NumPy
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

- Checked for missing values and data types
- Visualized distributions with pair plots and heatmaps
- Analyzed feature correlations
- Explored the relationship between features and target class

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Models

| Model                  | Description                            | Accuracy (Approx.) |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Support Vector Machine | Finds optimal hyperplane               | ~97%                |
| K-Nearest Neighbors    | Classifies based on nearest data points| ~96%                |
| Decision Tree          | Rule-based tree structure              | ~95%                |

All models were trained and evaluated on a test set split (80/20) and showed strong performance.
